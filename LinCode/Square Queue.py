You should select some of them to form a square(That is, the number of rows and columns is equal), and the maximum height difference of each row should not exceed 2.
What is the maximum number of people you can choose to form the square?

1 \leq N \leq 10^51≤N≤10 
5
 
1 \leq height[i] \leq 10^91≤height[i]≤10 
9
